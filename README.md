# Data Analytics Portfolio by Alifandi Rahmatul Ilmi
# About me
Hi, I'm Alifandi,
a fresh graduate of the Biology major with research experience and scientific publications. Given the dynamics of current technology development, I decided to switch careers in the data field to become a Data Analyst. The field of Data Analytics is new to me, so I started this new journey by joining a virtual internship program as a Business Intelligence analyst, which was carried out in collaboration between Bank Muamalat and Rakamin Academy. After joining this internship, I was able to learn many things so that I have skills such as SQL Operation, Excel Data Processing, Data Visualization, Statistics, Business Acumen, and BI Tools: Dashboard. I applied these skills in the data analysis process to provide analytical insights and propose suggestions to improve sales performance. The tools I use in the data analysis process include Excel, Google BigQuery (SQL), and Google Data Studio.
 
In addition to the above tools, I have a deep interest in learning about the big data analysis process using Python and being part of a company that can uncover hidden insights for business improvement. I'm a forever learner and welcome any recommendations on things to do that challenge me to always have a growth mindset.
